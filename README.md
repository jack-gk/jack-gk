## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me

Data Scientist & Developer building real-world solutions with data, cloud and code. I‚Äôm a huge fan of **Python, SQL** and crafting & optimising ML models.  
When I‚Äôm away from the keyboard you‚Äôll catch me on the football pitch, throwing punches at my boxing club or clocking the miles as I train for a half-marathon this September.

Currently contracting for **i-three management**, wrangling police data into actionable insight.
