📚 Projects Examples

Diabetic Readmission Prediction
• Developed a predictive model to estimate hospital readmission risk for diabetic patients using public health datasets.
• Built an end-to-end ML pipeline: data cleaning, feature engineering, logistic regression & XGBoost, ROC/AUC evaluation.
• Achieved 82% test accuracy and delivered a prototype visual interface for risk scoring.

Clustering & Insight Platform (i-three analytics)
• Designed a system to explore hierarchical clustering on geospatial policing data.
• Plotted polar, linear and colour-coded, graphical 2d/3d plots.
• Dimension reduction algorithms utilised such as PCA and UMAP
